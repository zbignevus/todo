This project was bootstrapped by using React-Create-App npm module.

This is a Todo application that I have created by using React for building components for the front-end and tied it up with a database deployed on Firebase.

Easy to use, feel free to test it out by cloning the repository, typing <code>npm install</code> on the command line while in the project's directory to install the required modules and then run with <code>npm start</code>
